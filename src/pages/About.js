          <p>
            We are a passionate team of undergraduate engineers at Johns Hopkins University, 
            dedicated to pushing the boundaries of collegiate rocketry through innovation, 
            collaboration, and hands-on learning.

            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
              The Astrojays Rocket Team is a student-run, cross-disciplinary organization 
              that focuses on innovation in collegiate high power rocketry and international 
              rocketry competitions. Since our founding, we've created projects that inspire 
              team members and push the boundaries of what's possible in student rocketry.
            </p>
            <p>
              We emphasize simplicity, design for manufacturing, frequent hardware testing, 
              ownership, and launching as often as possible. Our team engages students with 
              experimental motor design, composite structures, control systems, telemetry, 
              high performance, and propulsion projects.
