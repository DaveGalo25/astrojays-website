Here is information for the rocket and motor descriptions becuase all the rockets and motors currently on the site are fake: 
Stellaris

Our most recent project Stellaris took us to new speeds and heights. Stellaris was a 4” diameter, 9ft tall, 40lb rocket powered by our Prometheus solid rocket engine. Stellaris was 99% student engineered, with the team manufacturing nearly all aerostructures and avionic systems in-house. We launched Stellaris in the Mojave Desert at the 2025 FAR 51025 Unlimited Competition where it reached a maximum speed of Mach 1.2, reached an altitude of 17943ft, and pulled over 20g’s at Max-Q. Using aerodynamic simulations, we predicted an apogee of 18,000 ft, placing us 2nd in the competition. 

Rocket Height: 9ft
Weight: 47lbs
Motor: PN-02 (M2500)
Apogee: 18,000ft
Max Speed: Mach 1.1 (770mph)
Max Acceleration: 20g

IREC ‘26 Rocket

Our rocket project for 2026 is an exciting one! We plan on attending the International Rocket Engineering Competition next summer in Texas. The currently untitled rocket is currently still in the design phase, but is projected to reach speeds exceeding Mach 2, and a target altitude of 30,000ft, which is the cruising altitude for most airliners!

Rocket Height: 14ft
Weight: ~100lbs
Apogee: 30,000ft (Projected)
Motor: O6000 (Predicted)
Max Speed: Mach 1.8 (1330mph Projected) 
Max Acceleration: 20g

Baja Blast

Baja Blast was our first attempt at a two-stage rocket. Implementing extremely complex avionics systems to control stage separation was the highlight of this vehicle. We designed custom PCBs using Kalman Filtering to accurately determine the orientation, velocity, and acceleration of the rocket to control the stage separation event. During the launch, the first stage engine.

Rocket Height: 12ft
Weight: ~50lbs
Apogee: 10,000ft (Predicted)
Motor: 1st stage K1200 | 2nd stage K375
Max Speed: Mach 0.8 
Max Acceleration: 8g

Strugglebus

Strugglebus was our first ever competition rocket, launching at the Mojave Desert FAR Launch Site in 2022. Powered by an Aerotech L1000 solid rocket motor, Strugglebus reached an altitude of 10,000ft, and a speed of Mach 0.8, setting a club record at the time and placing second at the FAR Unlimited Competition.

Rocket Height: 9ft
Weight: ~30lbs
Apogee: 10,000ft 
Motor: L1000
Max Speed: Mach 0.8
Max Acceleration: 10g

Motors

Hybrid BJ-01

The first ever rocket motor developed by JHU students, BJ-01 was a Hybrid rocket engine fueled by Nitrous Oxide and Paraffin Wax. It was hot-fired successfully at a JHU APL test site in 2019. 

Weight: ~30lbs
Motor Class: N2000
Propellant: NO2+Paraffin Wax 

Prometheus PN-01

Weight: 26lbs
Motor Class: M4000
Propellant: Ammonium Perchlorate Composite Propellant 

Prometheus is our large scale M-Class solid rocket motor. With five 4” diameter APCP propellant grains, PN-01 was the most ambitious motor we've ever made, weighing 26lbs with an expected 800lbf of thrust, and a chamber pressure of 800psi. Unfortunately PN-01 suffered a casing burst due to an overpressurization failure during a static-fire test. 

Prometheus PN-02

Weight: 26lbs
Motor Class: M2500
Propellant: Ammonium Perchlorate Composite Propellant 

A development of PN-01, Prometheus version 2 corrects the issues identified while testing PN-01. PN-02 uses the same casing and bulkhead design as the first version, featuring a widened nozzle throat and 6 grains of APCP propellant to limit internal chamber pressure to 400psi. PN-02 was successfully built and fired twice. Once as a static-fire test, and once as the propulsion system for the Stellaris rocket.
